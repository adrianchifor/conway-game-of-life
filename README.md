## Conway's Game of Life in Python using pygame

Each cell with one or no neighbours dies because of loneliness. Each cell with four or more neighbours dies because of overpopulation. Each cell with two or three neighbours survives.

To run make sure you have Python and pygame installed, cd into the folder and run 'python game_of_life.py' in shell.

The grid update speed can be changed by modifying the 'REFRESH' variable (currently set to 2ms). New cells can be created by clicking or holding the click and dragging inside the grid.
